# Assessing Tremor in Parkinson's Disease

## Simon Mercer

## Student project: Data Science Program, Galvanize, Inc.

## Description
The focus of this project will be a detailed characterization of patient tremor and the extent to which tremor characteristics are related to, and predictive of, severity, symptoms, and treatment response.

This project will determine determine the extent to which a smartphone accelerometer is an effective tool for the collection of tremor data, and to investigate the extent to which medication can control tremor in a patient with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease.

The initial approach will be logistic regression.
